I'm building an app that's akin to WhatsApp, allowing users to chat using Bluetooth connectivity. Devices can establish direct connections, enabling effortless communication without relying on the internet. Currently, users can effortlessly send and receive messages, and they receive timely notifications for new messages. I have an exciting roadmap ahead, with planned enhancements and optimizations to elevate the app's performance, overall user experience and to be released in play store.
